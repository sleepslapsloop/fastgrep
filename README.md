# Fastgrep

My simple implementation of grep. It prints all the lines in a text file that contain the given string. I  just made this for fun and to show I can use C and python together(idk why you would, but I did lol). This is in no way close to the real GNU grep which has been optimised and written in pure C. But if you want to only use this for some godforsaken reason, using pypy3 instead of python interpreter will increase performance slightly.

## Installation

Clone the repo to install.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sleepslapsloop/fastgrep.git
```

## Project Structure and Usage
The directory is structured as follows:
```bash
fastgrep/
├── c_lib/
│ ├── fastgrep.c
│ ├── makefile
│ └── libfastgrep.so    # generated by make
├── data/
│ └── example.txt
├── fastgrep.py
├──README.md
└── .gitignore
```
The text files are stored in data by default.
```bash
cd fastgrep
python fastgrep.py <filename.txt> <string> 
``` 
For example ```python fastgrep.py example.txt world ```.
Alternatively, if the file is stored in another folder, you can use ```-p``` flag. Note that the order of arguments is important.
```bash
python fastgrep.py <filename.txt> -p <path to file without final '/'> <string>
```
For example if the file path is ```~/Desktop/Folder/Text.txt```, the command would be 
 ```python fastgrep.py Text.txt -p ~/Desktop/Folder hello```
