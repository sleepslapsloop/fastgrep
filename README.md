# Fastgrep

My simple implementation of grep. It prints all the lines in a text file that contain the given string.

## Installation

Clone the repo to install.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sleepslapsloop/fastgrep.git
```

## Project Structure and Usage
The directory is structured as follows:
```bash
fastgrep/
├── c_lib/
│ ├── fastgrep.c
│ ├── makefile
│ └── libfastgrep.so    # generated by make
├── data/
│ ├── example.txt
├── fastgrep.py
├──README.md
└── .gitignore
```
The text files are stored in data by default.
```bash
cd fastgrep
python fastgrep.py <filename.txt> <string> 
``` 
For example ```python fastgrep.py example.txt world ```.
Alternatively, if the file is stored in another folder, you can use ```-p``` flag. Note that the order of arguments is important.
```bash
python fastgrep.py <filename.txt> -p <path to file without final '/'> <string>
```
For example if the file path is ```~/Desktop/Folder/Text.txt```, the command would be 
 ```python fastgrep.py Text.txt -p ~/Desktop/Folder hello```
